rt3562sta-linux
===============

Public repository with ralink rt3562sta linux kernel module, patched to work on recent kernels.

This driver should work with ralink mPCI(e) cards rt3062, rt3562, rt3060, rt3592 and maybe some others.

===============

Current version should work also on x86_64 kernel (where older version caused kernel panic), support dual band (2.4 and 5Ghz) and monitor mode (channel switching) should also work correctly.
